# Operator precedence

Multiply and divide are always done first, then add and subtract (the calculation is always evaluated from left to right. ie for * and / will be xecuted based on the order from left to right). This could be overwritten by using paranthesis.

# Numbers vs strings

_"123"+ 4 = '1234'_

Convert to Numbers and String using Number() and String() functions.
