# Operator precedence

Multiply and divide are always done first, then add and subtract (the calculation is always evaluated from left to right. ie for * and / will be xecuted based on the order from left to right). This could be overwritten by using paranthesis.

# Numbers vs strings

_"123"+ 4 = '1234'_

Convert to Numbers and String using Number() and String() functions.

# Useful string methods

 - "mozilla".length: Finding the length of a string
 - "mozilla"[0]: Retrieving a specific string character
 - "mozilla".includes("zilla"): if a string contains a substring
 - The below program can printout the number of occurances of a substring in a string

    ![image](https://github.com/manojake/javascript-playground/assets/68778250/9a83ccbc-d208-4914-912c-34b9f5e6fbc0)

 - "mozilla".slice(1, 4)); // "ozi"  Extracting a substring from a string

# Arrays

Property can also be assigned to arrays. For instance arrayObj.myprop = 'myProp' is a valid piece of code.

An array can be cleared by setting it's length to 0

- Array.push() returns the new length of the array
- Array.pop() removes and returns the last item
- Array.shift() removes and returns the first item
- Array.splice(startingIndex, #ofItemstoBeRemoved)
- Array.toString() returns a comma seperated string
- Array.join() will return a string with speration char of your own

# Anonymous functions

_Note: Functions in an object are called methods._

![image](https://github.com/manojake/javascript-playground/assets/68778250/4c9170b3-e27a-478a-849a-cef60ac2099e)

# Javascript Objects

Below is an example of an object which accepts name as a contructor parameter

![image](https://github.com/manojake/javascript-playground/assets/68778250/4a0151ae-c069-49b5-8c45-f9f58163bf32)

If you define a private variable like `let fullName = 'Manosh'`, it cannot be accessed or modified from outside the function. If you set the property fullName after
creating the object, it would be same as initilizing this.fullName inside the function. this.fullName and let fullName can co exist in a function and are totaly different.

# Object prototypes

_Note: Plain object literals do not have prototype. Prototype is available for constructor functions only. But if you have a Car object literal. You can create a new Honda object with the prototype set as Car by using const honda = Object.create(Car). Then honda will have prototype of Car. But Car itself does not have prototype._

When you try to access a property of an object: if the property can't be found in the object itself, the prototype is searched for the property. If the property still can't be found, then the prototype's prototype is searched, and so on until either the property is found, or the end of the chain is reached, in which case undefined is returned.

_Note: If the property being searched for is an object, any changes to its properties will affect the parent and all children. This is because the object is stored as a reference in memory. The searched-for property only holds a reference to that object, and all object copies refer to the same instance._

To find out the prototype of an object, we can use the function Object.getPrototypeOf(). Object.prototype, and it is the most basic prototype, that all objects have by default. The prototype of Object.prototype is null, so it's at the end of the prototype chain.

_Note: The prototype of an object is not always Object.prototype_

If the protoype of an object is set at any popint of time, all the object that are created prior to setting the protype will aslo have access to the newly created prototype property

## Inheritance

- How to create an new object ,if you have an existing object as a prototype.

  ![image](https://github.com/manojake/javascript-playground/assets/68778250/fdf5de50-477e-4f00-8541-4ef9d87925da)

In the above example, person object is set as the prototype of manosh opbject. if name property was not set on manosh object, manosh would get the name property from it's prototype and it would have printed undefined.

## Introducing constructors

The above example is hard to manage. Same code has to be repeated to create new obhects and need tp remember to set the name propery for the greet function to work. This could get complex very easily. That means the object literal in the above is not always adequate. Hence we could rewrite the above example like this

![image](https://github.com/manojake/javascript-playground/assets/68778250/b272c4f4-bcf6-4342-9c86-2dc4c7366bd5)

This works fine but is a bit long-winded: we have to create an empty object, initialize it, and return it. A better way is to use a constructor. A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword
and it will

_Note: Constructors, by convention, start with a capital letter and are named for the type of object they create_

### Using a constructor

![image](https://github.com/manojake/javascript-playground/assets/68778250/1e3db16f-1526-4b22-93a2-8253cc006c24)

## Method overriding

The prototype of object and function are different.The prototype of an object (Object.prototype) provides methods for all objects, like toString() and hasOwnProperty(), while the prototype of a function (Function.prototype) provides methods specifically for functions, like call() and apply().

Note: While Function.prototype is specifically for functions, it ultimately inherits from Object.prototype at the root level.

# Classes and constructors

- This how you declare a class

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4485c3cf-f72e-461f-8196-68ffa5a7fa65)

If you came from a pre-ES6 world, you may be more familiar with using functions as constructors.
The pattern above would roughly translate to the following with function constructors:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12d39af0-6a7d-4ee8-bf1f-bdba7cad6980)

_Note: Private fields and methods are new features in classes with no trivial equivalent in function constructors._

_Note: Class declaration are not hoisted which means you cannot use a class before it is declared.
This behavior is similar to variables declared with let and const_

_Note: The this value will be automatically returned as the result of new. You are advised to not return any value from the constructor â€” because if you return a non-primitive value,
it will become the value of the new expression, and the value of this is dropped._

Here the #name does not have to be there. But it is a good practice to set it all there so the you can keep track of those variables.

![image](https://github.com/manojake/javascript-playground/assets/68778250/baaa58fb-96ea-49c3-b29e-0bfbb2fbe982)

- Methods in the classes are stored at the prototype level. For intance, in the below example the function references are same. That means new functions are not created
  for all the instances of Red. Instead every instance get to use the same function avaiulable in the prototype. But the key point here is that _this_ will always be different for each
  object created.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b327fccd-8f7e-475a-a710-ad024723dae7)

# Inheritance

- In the below example _this_ is only available after super is called. Accessing _this_ before that will result in a syntax error.
- Professor can also override any methods from Person class. You just have to re-define the method. But if you wanna still access
  the parent method which is being overriden, access it by super.overridenMethod()

## Closures

A closure gives a function access to its outer scope. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

JavaScript allows for the nesting of functions and grants the inner function full access to all the variables and functions defined inside the outer function (and all other variables and functions that the outer function has access to).

However, the outer function does not have access to the variables and functions defined inside the inner function. This provides a sort of encapsulation for the variables of the inner function.

if the inner function manages to survive beyond the life of the outer function, the variables and functions defined in the outer function will live longer than the duration of the outer function.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7020a6f-f55c-48de-91d4-ec8b07d6fa97)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/506905b5-17c2-4f7e-9343-4f3a89cc3410)

_Note: By default object literals properties are always public. If there is a need of creating private variables, constructors are the way to go and those private variables can only be changes using the inner functions since they are the only ones that has access to it. A complex example would be an object containing methods for manipulating the inner variables of the outer function can be returned._

## Closure performance impact

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ac22575-9946-42b2-9dbb-09a25d3407e4)

This could be simply fixed as shown below. here the methods areappended to the existing prototype:

## Arrow functions

Arrow function does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target.Arrow functions are always anonymous.

### No speparate this

Until arrow functions, every new function defined its own this value. ie

    A new object in case of a constructor function. That means this refer the to the currtent object context

    this will be undefines in strict mode function calls

    this will be the base object if the function ia method in an object literal

# Map object

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec54d784-665a-4751-bce3-eab30871e235)

- How to decide whether to use a Map or an Object
  - Use Map when you need keys that are not just strings or symbols. Maps can use any value (including objects and functions) as keys.
  - Use Map when you need to preserve the insertion order of key-value pairs.
  - Map is optimized for frequent additions and removals of key-value pairs
  - Use obejct when the keys are plain strings
  - Use object when it's going to be serialized for transmission

# Set object

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d723af5c-6411-4876-8b31-c062c5f1446f)

You can convert an array to set by new Set([1,2]). Set constructor accepts an array as a parameter.

Convert Set to an array by Array.from(new Set([1,2]))

# Getters and Setters

Person object is using set and get. But the same can be achieved using object methods as well. Please note that object methods does not create their own _this_. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87dfea86-0bc6-44cb-bd9c-acba0c46bb5d)

The same can be acheievd in function constructors using either plain public functions or set the obejct literal as a prototype for the function and define getters and setters on the prototype.
- Array and Set compared
  - Deleting an element from array using splice is slow compared tp set.delete
  - By using set , you dont have to keep tracj of duplicate values

# Execution contexts

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2505417f-a897-4312-aef5-83dca4dd8b73)

# Runtime Agents

To run JavaScript code, the runtime engine maintains a set of agents in which to execute JavaScript code. Each agent is made up of a **set of execution contexts, the execution context stack, a main thread, a set for any additional threads that may be created to handle workers, a task queue, and a microtask queue**.

# Event loops

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b49e38b9-1f3f-44c8-be94-2316b8812a32)

# Task vs Micro tasks

Promise callbacks are handled as a microtask whereas setTimeout() callbacks are handled as task queues.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c83311c9-a627-4135-a17b-986a313aaec5)

Let's analyze the above code in detail.

1. The program is initiated. Hence that's a task added to the queue. In the first event loop iteration this task is executed. Thus `Program initiated` is logged.
2. When the Promise constructor is called, the executor function (the function passed as an argument) runs immediately, synchronously. Hence `Promise callback` is logged next.
3. The .then will add a microtask to the queue and will only executed after the task is completed. Hence `Promise (pending)` is logged next since that will be the end of the task. 

Note: The .then method adds a microtask to the queue, which will be executed after the current synchronous task completes. When "Promise (pending)" is logged, the promise is technically already resolved, but the .then handler hasnâ€™t executed yet because microtasks run after the synchronous code. This is why the promise still shows as pending.

4. Now the task is completed and agent starts executing microtask queue which will log `Promise callback (.then)`. Now there are no more microtasks, the first iteration of the event loop is completed.
5. In the next iteration setimeout task is executed . Hence `event-loop cycle: Promise (fulfilled)` is logged



Lets take another example. First there is a getData proto function

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89183b02-6a95-4318-b0bd-3fbc918456c0)

Secondly a code that calls this function

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fa07b82-f2d6-4827-a4c2-eb14e33815cc)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8ff1f2c-3f30-4dd2-8f26-9cb529ee271c)


1. The event listener for the "load" event is added synchronously, which means it will trigger whenever the "load" event is dispatched.
2.  "Fetching dataâ€¦" is logged immediately because it is part of the current synchronous execution within the first event loop iteration.
3. When getData is called and the data is not cached, the fetch operation begins asynchronously. The .then callback is not added to the microtask queue immediately; instead, they will be added only after the fetch operation completes successfully.
4.After initiating the fetch, the synchronous code continues, and "Data fetched" is logged. This occurs before the fetch completes and before any microtasks (like the .then handlers) are processed.
5. When the fetch completes, the first .then block is added to the microtask queue. This .then block processes the fetch result (e.g., converting it to an arrayBuffer).

  After the first .then completes, the second .then callback is added to the same microtask queue, which will cache the data and dispatch the "load" event.

6. The microtasks are executed in sequence. The first .then is processed, followed by the second .then which dispatches the "load" event. Because the microtask queue is emptied before returning to the task queue, everything in the microtask queue, including event dispatch, happens immediately in the same microtask cycle.
   
7. The "load" event listenerâ€™s callback (console.log("Loaded data")) is executed synchronously when the event is dispatched. Since this happens within the same microtask phase, "Loaded data" is logged last, after all other synchronous code and microtasks are complete.

The first output screenshot is the expected behaviour but the above code works differently in the if/else clause. We could make it consistent by modifying the code

# Batching operations using queueMicrotask

Consider the below code block

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2eb0b867-0d71-42c8-a042-694082e37875)

When sendMessage() gets called, the specified message is first pushed onto the message queue array. Then things get interesting.

1. When the first message is added to messageQueue, a microtask is queued using queueMicrotask(). The main thread continues to run any remaining synchronous code. This microtask will run once the current execution context completes.
2. Any further calls to sendMessage will add more messages to messageQueue, but no additional microtasks are queued. This is because the microtask is only scheduled when the queue is empty, ensuring that only one microtask processes the entire batch of messages.

  The queued microtask maintains a reference to the messageQueue, so any messages added after the first one will be included in the batch processed by the microtask.
  
3. When the main thread reaches the end of the current synchronous code and begins processing microtasks, the queued microtask is executed. At this point, all messages that were accumulated in messageQueue are stringified into JSON format.

The array messageQueue is cleared (messageQueue.length = 0) to reset it for the next batch, and the fetch function is called with the batched messages.

4. This process demonstrates how batching is achieved. By only queuing a single microtask for the first message and accumulating subsequent messages in the array, the code ensures that all messages sent within the same event loop iteration are processed together in a single batch.

# Generators

A generator in JavaScript is a special type of function that can pause its execution and later resume from where it left off. Instead of returning a single value, generators use the yield keyword to produce multiple values one at a time. They return an iterator object, which can be used to control the generator's execution.
