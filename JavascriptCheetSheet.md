# Operator precedence

Multiply and divide are always done first, then add and subtract (the calculation is always evaluated from left to right. ie for * and / will be xecuted based on the order from left to right). This could be overwritten by using paranthesis.

# Numbers vs strings

_"123"+ 4 = '1234'_

Convert to Numbers and String using Number() and String() functions.

# Useful string methods

 - "mozilla".length: Finding the length of a string
 - "mozilla"[0]: Retrieving a specific string character
 - "mozilla".includes("zilla"): if a string contains a substring
 - The below program can printout the number of occurances of a substring in a string

 - "mozilla".slice(1, 4)); // "ozi"  Extracting a substring from a string

# Arrays

Property can also be assigned to arrays. For instance arrayObj.myprop = 'myProp' is a valid piece of code.

An array can be cleared by setting it's length to 0

- Array.push() returns the new length of the array
- Array.pop() removes and returns the last item
- Array.shift() removes and returns the first item
- Array.splice(startingIndex, #ofItemstoBeRemoved)
- Array.toString() returns a comma seperated string
- Array.join() will return a string with speration char of your own

# Anonymous functions

_Note: Functions in an object are called methods._

# Javascript Objects

Below is an example of an object which accepts name as a contructor parameter

![image](https://github.com/manojake/javascript-playground/assets/68778250/4a0151ae-c069-49b5-8c45-f9f58163bf32)

If you define a private variable like `let fullName = 'Manosh'`, it cannot be accessed or modified from outside the function. If you set the property fullName after
creating the object, it would be same as initilizing this.fullName inside the function. this.fullName and let fullName can co exist in a function and are totaly different.

# Object prototypes

_Note: Plain object literals do not have prototype. Prototype is available for constructor functions only. But if you have a Car object literal. You can create a new Honda object with the prototype set as Car by using const honda = Object.create(Car). Then honda will have prototype of Car. But Car itself does not have prototype._

When you try to access a property of an object: if the property can't be found in the object itself, the prototype is searched for the property. If the property still can't be found, then the prototype's prototype is searched, and so on until either the property is found, or the end of the chain is reached, in which case undefined is returned.

_Note: If the property being searched for is an object, any changes to its properties will affect the parent and all children. This is because the object is stored as a reference in memory. The searched-for property only holds a reference to that object, and all object copies refer to the same instance._

To find out the prototype of an object, we can use the function Object.getPrototypeOf(). Object.prototype, and it is the most basic prototype, that all objects have by default. The prototype of Object.prototype is null, so it's at the end of the prototype chain.

_Note: The prototype of an object is not always Object.prototype_

If the protoype of an object is set at any popint of time, all the object that are created prior to setting the protype will aslo have access to the newly created prototype property

## Inheritance

- How to create an new object ,if you have an existing object as a prototype.

  ![image](https://github.com/manojake/javascript-playground/assets/68778250/fdf5de50-477e-4f00-8541-4ef9d87925da)

In the above example, person object is set as the prototype of manosh opbject. if name property was not set on manosh object, manosh would get the name property from it's prototype and it would have printed undefined.

## Introducing constructors

The above example is hard to manage. Same code has to be repeated to create new obhects and need tp remember to set the name propery for the greet function to work. This could get complex very easily. That means the object literal in the above is not always adequate. Hence we could rewrite the above example like this

![image](https://github.com/manojake/javascript-playground/assets/68778250/b272c4f4-bcf6-4342-9c86-2dc4c7366bd5)

This works fine but is a bit long-winded: we have to create an empty object, initialize it, and return it. A better way is to use a constructor. A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword
and it will

_Note: Constructors, by convention, start with a capital letter and are named for the type of object they create_

# Classes and constructors

- This how you declare a class

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4485c3cf-f72e-461f-8196-68ffa5a7fa65)

If you came from a pre-ES6 world, you may be more familiar with using functions as constructors.
The pattern above would roughly translate to the following with function constructors:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12d39af0-6a7d-4ee8-bf1f-bdba7cad6980)

_Note: Private fields and methods are new features in classes with no trivial equivalent in function constructors._

_Note: Class declaration are not hoisted which means you cannot use a class before it is declared.
This behavior is similar to variables declared with let and const_

_Note: The this value will be automatically returned as the result of new. You are advised to not return any value from the constructor â€” because if you return a non-primitive value,
it will become the value of the new expression, and the value of this is dropped._

Here the #name does not have to be there. But it is a good practice to set it all there so the you can keep track of those variables.

![image](https://github.com/manojake/javascript-playground/assets/68778250/baaa58fb-96ea-49c3-b29e-0bfbb2fbe982)

- Methods in the classes are stored at the prototype level. For intance, in the below example the function references are same. That means new functions are not created
  for all the instances of Red. Instead every instance get to use the same function avaiulable in the prototype. But the key point here is that _this_ will always be different for each
  object created.

# Inheritance

- In the below example _this_ is only available after super is called. Accessing _this_ before that will result in a syntax error.
- Professor can also override any methods from Person class. You just have to re-define the method. But if you wanna still access
  the parent method which is being overriden, access it by super.overridenMethod()

## Closures

JavaScript allows for the nesting of functions and grants the inner function full access to all the variables and functions defined inside the outer function (and all other variables and functions that the outer function has access to).

However, the outer function does not have access to the variables and functions defined inside the inner function. This provides a sort of encapsulation for the variables of the inner function.

if the inner function manages to survive beyond the life of the outer function, the variables and functions defined in the outer function will live longer than the duration of the outer function.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/506905b5-17c2-4f7e-9343-4f3a89cc3410)

_Note: By default object literals properties are always public. If there is a need of creating private variables, constructors are the way to go and those private variables can only be changes using the inner functions since they are the only ones that has access to it. A complex example would be an object containing methods for manipulating the inner variables of the outer function can be returned._

## Arrow functions

Arrow function does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target.Arrow functions are always anonymous.

### No speparate this

Until arrow functions, every new function defined its own this value. ie

    A new object in case of a constructor function. That means this refer the to the currtent object context

    this will be undefines in strict mode function calls

    this will be the base object if the function ia method in an object literal

# Map object

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec54d784-665a-4751-bce3-eab30871e235)

- How to decide whether to use a Map or an Object
  - Use Map when you need keys that are not just strings or symbols. Maps can use any value (including objects and functions) as keys.
  - Use Map when you need to preserve the insertion order of key-value pairs.
  - Map is optimized for frequent additions and removals of key-value pairs
  - Use obejct when the keys are plain strings
  - Use object when it's going to be serialized for transmission

# Set object

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d723af5c-6411-4876-8b31-c062c5f1446f)

You can convert an array to set by new Set([1,2]). Set constructor accepts an array as a parameter.

Convert Set to an array by Array.from(new Set([1,2]))

# Getters and Setters

Person object is using set and get. But the same can be achieved using object methods as well. Please note that object methods does not create their own _this_. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87dfea86-0bc6-44cb-bd9c-acba0c46bb5d)

The same can be acheievd in function constructors using either plain public functions or set the obejct literal as a prototype for the function and define getters and setters on the prototype.
- Array and Set compared
  - Deleting an element from array using splice is slow compared tp set.delete
  - By using set , you dont have to keep tracj of duplicate values
